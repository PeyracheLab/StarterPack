Here we go into more details about neuroseries
and learn how to use one of the most important function : realign

# In this first example, we are gonna create some fake data of head-direction neurons
# So we need spike times and angular position
# The idea is to construct a tuning curve
# For the moment we don't care if the tuning curve is ugly

# let's imagine that the animal is moving his head clockwise at a constant speed
angle = np.arange(0, 100, 0.1)
# let's bring that between 0 and 2pi
angle = angle%(2*np.pi)
# let's imagine the sampling rate is 100Hz for detecting the position of the animal
# So we have a dt of
dt = 1/100.
# and a duration of
duration = dt*len(angle)
# let's put angle in a neuroseries tsd
angle = nts.Tsd(t = np.arange(0, duration, dt), d = angle, time_units = 's')

# now let's imagine we have some spikes
spikes = np.sort(np.random.uniform(0, duration, 100))
spikes = nts.Ts(spikes, time_units = 's')

# We can plot both angle and spikes together
figure()
plot(angle)
plot(spikes.times(), np.zeros(len(spikes)), '|', markersize = 10)
show()

#So the question is: What was the corresponding angular position when a spike was recorded
# To do that, you use realign which basically takes the closed angle value in time from the spike
angle_spike = angle.realign(spikes)
# The order matters here! it's not spikes.realign(angle)
# let's look at what it does
figure()
plot(angle)
plot(spikes.times(), np.zeros(len(spikes)), '|', markersize = 10)
plot(angle_spike, 'o', markersize = 5)
show()
# Observe how the spike times are aligned with the dot 

# Now it's easy to get a tuning curve
# You just do a histogram of angle_spike
# Which is basically counting the spikes 
# First you define bins between 0 and 2pi for example 30 bins
bins = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 30)
spike_count, bin_edges = np.histogram(angle_spike, bins)

# But maybe the animal spend most of its time in one particular direction
# You need thus to correct for occupancy
# For that you do the histogram of the angle WITH THE SAME BINS
occupancy, _ = np.histogram(angle, bins)

# So correcting for occupancy give :
spike_count = spike_count/occupancy

# Still it's just a spike count
# You need a frequency and it's given by the sampling frequency of the camera that track the position
tuning_curve = spike_count/dt

# let's put that in a nice dataframe
# it's not a time series so no need to use nts
tuning_curve = pd.DataFrame(index = bins[0:-1]+np.diff(bins)/2, data = tuning_curve)

# Now let's plot that along with the spikes
figure()

plot(spikes.times(), np.zeros(len(spikes)), '|', markersize = 10)
plot(angle_spike, 'o', markersize = 5)
subplot(212)
plot(tuning_curve)
show()

# Ok it's ugly but who cares
# It's just random data

# This second example is about constructing a place field
# so this time, the spikes times are realigned to a 2d position
# Let's imagine the animal is in a circular environment this time
xpos = np.cos(angle.values)+np.random.randn(len(angle))*0.05
ypos = np.sin(angle.values)+np.random.randn(len(angle))*0.05

# We can stack the x,y position in a TsdFrame
position = np.vstack((xpos, ypos)).T
position = nts.TsdFrame(t = angle.times(), d = position, columns = ['x', 'y'])

# and we can plot it
figure()
plot(position['x'], position['y'])
show()

# Now it's the same as before
# except the histogram is in 2d
position_spike = position.realign(spikes)
xbins = np.linspace(xpos.min(), xpos.max()+0.01, 10)
ybins = np.linspace(ypos.min(), ypos.max()+0.01, 10)
spike_count2,_,_ = np.histogram2d(position_spike['y'], position_spike['x'], [ybins,xbins])
occupancy2, _, _ = np.histogram2d(position['y'], position['x'], [ybins,xbins])
spike_count2 = spike_count2/(occupancy2+1)
place_field = spike_count2/dt

# Let's put that in a nice dataframe
place_field = pd.DataFrame(index = xbins[0:-1]+np.diff(xbins)/2,
							columns = ybins[0:-1]+np.diff(ybins)/2,
							data = place_field)


# And plot everything
